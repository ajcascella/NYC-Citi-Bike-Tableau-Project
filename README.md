## Background

For this project I aggregated data in Python and Pandas using Citi Bike Trip History Logs and found two unexpected phenomena. I also designed visualizations using Tableau for each discovered phenomena.  Within Tableau I also created dashboards and written analyses of the phenomena.  Lastly, I created a story within Tableau that brings together the visualizations, maps, and dashboards.
